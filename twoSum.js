// problem : a number u is given. u is sum of two numbers in the array. we have to find that two numbers.

// sorting the array
// seting point in two edges , setting a middle point.
//if the sum of i+j is bigger it shall come left from the higher boundary.
//if sum is little than the target it shall come to one right direction from i


const array=[23,88,8,35,14,53,67,98,80,32];
array.sort(function(a,b){return a-b});

//if the sum becomes greater 
while()
console.log("array:",array)
